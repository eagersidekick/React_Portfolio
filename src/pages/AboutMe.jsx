        <p>My name is Heather Crawford. I am a student coder currently enrolled in KU's Coding Bootcamp.</p>
        <p>I am a professional professional with a variety of career experiences under my belt.</p>
        <p>I graduated from UMKC with a BA in Secondary Education and English. I worked in public and private education
            for seven years, five years as a high school English teacher. From there, I moved on to adult education
            working for Oracle-Cerner to develop professional level medical software training curriculum and documents.
            Working with coders and software experts sparked an interest in coding and app development. To that end, I
            am currently a student coder enrolled in KU’s Coding Bootcamp!</p>
        <p>While my many professional lives may seem unrelated, they have all been guided forward by my passion for
            creative problem solving and sincere desire to learn and grow. My experiences as a teacher taught me
            patience and how to break down complicated problems into bite sized pieces. I firmly believe that one year
            in a classroom is enough to train even the most timid of individuals the confidence needed to tackle any
            surprise challenge; I’ve had seven. Working with Oracle has taught me the power of a team, and how to look
            far forward and backward into a project’s life to ensure that the product you create is in line with the
            expected goals and will continue to work for the consumer for years to come.</p>
        <p>I am excited to begin my new path as a coder, and cannnot wait to see what new skills lie around the corner!</p>
